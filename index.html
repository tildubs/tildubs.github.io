Given the updated requirement, where the parent element must now control the size of the game canvas instead of relying on the game to size itself, you can still use a similar HTML structure but adjust the styling to explicitly size the canvas. Assuming you'll have a <canvas> element for the game (which is common with WebAssembly and games), you can directly apply styles to ensure it fills the entire viewport, similar to the previous setup but targeting the canvas specifically.

Here's an example that directly sizes the canvas element:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<title>Bevy Game Canvas Fullscreen</title>
<style>
  html, body {
    height: 100%;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    overflow: hidden; /* Prevents scrolling */
  }
  #game-canvas {
    width: 100vw; /* 100% of the viewport width */
    height: 100vh; /* 100% of the viewport height */
    display: block; /* Ensures the canvas fills the parent */
    background-color: #000; /* Optional: just to visualize the canvas */
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<canvas id="game-canvas">
  <!-- Your Bevy WASM game will render here -->
</canvas>
<script>
  // JavaScript to load and initialize your Bevy WASM game could go here
  // Ensure to target the canvas by its ID
</script>
</body>
</html>
